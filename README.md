# Technologies
* Language: JavaScript (ES2015)
* Testing Library: Jasmine - http://jasmine.github.io/2.4/introduction.html

# Problem
Write a program in JavaScript that converts a sentence from English to Inflationary English.
Inflationary English takes words and word parts that sound the same as a number (e.g. “won” v. “one”)
and then inflates that to the next number (e.g. “won” becomes “two”). Provide tests for your program.

Here is an example input and output:
* Input: “Today I won an award for being awesome.
* Output: “Threeday I two an award five being awesome.
